# Encoder Dimensionality

---
# To Do
- Use new classes and images from "The Geometry of Concept Learning"
- Try prototype vs. linear regression generalization error as 
  explanatory factors for a number of different number of training
  examples. It could be that a model's capacity for few-shot
  prototype-learning generalization error is the best explanatory
  factor for model performance, in which case the equation
  from "The Geometry of Concept Learning" would provide the
  theoretical explanation as to why different geometrical 
  properties of the representations (e.g. high dimensionality)
  are correlated with encoding performance.
